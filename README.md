This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The Synth Zone

Synth Zone is an application I built for a project in a web application class based around Reactjs.

The application is rather simple, just a personal application that catalogs my arsenal of synths. 

In the long run, the application will be able to play clips from each synth and allow the user to mix 'n' match 
to create their own unique song. The +(plus) button is a part of this future functionality and is not currently working. 

There are no special instructions to run the application.
